//! Zone-based positional evaluation.
//!
//! The 36×36 board is divided into four concentric zones from each player's
//! perspective.  Pieces gain bonuses for advancing into enemy territory and

//!
//! # Performance
//!
//! Uses `classify_fast` (precomputed O(1) table lookup) instead of the
//! full `classify` function with branching logic.
